# Enterprise Templates 

Inherit any Enterprise standards. However, these standards are often high-level, and implementation teams require more granularity with respect to standards and guidelines.

This page will be a living document that advocates for diagrams we will produce for each scope.

## Theme: 4 R's

- **Right Diagram**
- **Right Audience**
- **Right Channel/Method**
- **Right Time**

## Diagram Families

Selecting the right diagram is a skill in itself. There are several diagram families to choose from. The most frequently used are listed below. Here in CGS Ireland, we rely on the skill of our architects to judge the right diagram type for the right audience that conveys the right level of information at the right time. (See 4 R's above)
