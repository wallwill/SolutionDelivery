# The Solution Intent Document (SID)

## Overview

A **Solution Intent Document (SID)** captures the **architectural vision, context, and rationale** behind a solution.  
It is not a detailed design document — it defines *what* the solution is intended to achieve, *why* it is being built that way, and *how* it aligns with enterprise architecture, strategy, and constraints.

The SID provides a **shared understanding** between business, delivery, and technology stakeholders, ensuring all parties are aligned on scope, intent, and key decisions before deep technical design begins.

---

## Purpose

The Solution Intent Document serves to:

- Establish **architectural intent** — linking business needs to solution direction.  
- Provide **traceability** from strategy → requirements → architecture → delivery.  
- Define **boundaries, constraints, and assumptions** early in the lifecycle.  
- Communicate the **solution’s vision, scope, and principles** clearly to all teams.  
- Act as a **governance artifact** for architecture review and approval.  

---

## When to Use

- Early in **solution definition** or **initiation** phases.  
- During **architecture review board (ARB)** preparation.  
- As an **input** to detailed design, program planning, or RFP/vendor engagement.  
- As a **baseline** for architectural change control and traceability.  

---

## Core Sections of a Solution Intent Document

The structure may vary across organizations, but a well-formed SID typically includes the following sections:

---

### 1. Executive Summary

A concise, non-technical overview describing:
- The **business problem or opportunity** being addressed.  
- The **desired outcomes** and **strategic alignment**.  
- The **scope** (what is included/excluded).  
- A **high-level summary** of the proposed solution direction.

---

### 2. Business Context and Drivers

Defines *why* the solution exists.

- Key business objectives and expected benefits.  
- Pain points, gaps, or drivers prompting change.  
- Alignment to enterprise strategy, target operating model, or transformation roadmap.  
- Critical success factors and KPIs.  

---

### 3. Solution Overview

Describes *what* the solution will do and its high-level architecture.

- Solution scope and capabilities.  
- Conceptual architecture diagram (context view).  
- Key components and integrations (with brief explanation).  
- Target users, consumers, or business units impacted.  

> **Tip:** Keep this at a conceptual level — leave implementation details for later design phases.

---

### 4. Architecture Principles and Approach

Defines the **guiding principles** and **approach** that shape the solution.

- Architectural principles (e.g., cloud-first, API-first, reusable-by-default).  
- Technology alignment to enterprise standards or reference architectures.  
- Chosen patterns or styles (e.g., microservices, event-driven, serverless).  
- Governance alignment (Well-Architected, security baselines, compliance).

---

### 5. Key Decisions and Trade-offs

Documents **major architectural decisions**, including rationale and implications.

- Decision summary (use ADRs for detail).  
- Trade-offs considered (e.g., build vs buy, platform selection).  
- Risks, mitigations, and outstanding decisions.  

> **Purpose:** Demonstrates transparency and architectural reasoning — not just the outcome.

---

### 6. Constraints and Assumptions

Lists known factors that influence solution design.

| Type | Example |
|------|----------|
| **Business Constraint** | Must go live by Q4 to meet regulatory deadline |
| **Technical Constraint** | Must run on existing Azure landing zone |
| **Assumption** | SSO integration will be available via enterprise identity provider |

---

### 7. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)

Captures the critical **quality attributes** of the solution — the “ilities”.

| Category | Examples |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Performance** | Response < 2s for 95% of requests |
| **Scalability** | Auto-scale to handle 10x seasonal traffic |
| **Availability** | 99.9% uptime |
| **Security** | Align with ISO27001 and CIS Benchmarks |
| **Maintainability** | Automated CI/CD deployment pipelines |
| **Observability** | Logging, tracing, and alerting integrated with monitoring tools |

---

### 8. Technology Stack and Dependencies

Outlines the **proposed technology components** and dependencies.

- Platforms, services, and products being used (with version or lifecycle info).  
- Reuse of approved enterprise technologies.  
- Identification of new or non-standard technologies (with rationale).  
- Dependency mapping (internal and external systems).  

> Integrate with your **Technology Inventory** and **TIME model** for lifecycle visibility.

---

### 9. Data and Integration Considerations

Summarizes how the solution will **handle data** and **interoperate**.

- Key data entities, flows, and storage considerations.  
- Integration approach (APIs, events, messaging, ETL).  
- Data security, privacy, and compliance implications (e.g., GDPR).  

---

### 10. Deployment and Environment Strategy

Describes **how and where** the solution will be deployed.

- Cloud provider or hosting model.  
- Environment model (dev, test, staging, production).  
- Deployment and release approach (manual vs CI/CD).  
- High-level operational ownership (run/support model).

---

### 11. Risks and Mitigations

Identifies key risks and proposed mitigations.

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Integration latency | Medium | High | Introduce caching and async messaging |
| Vendor lock-in | High | Medium | Use abstraction layer for portability |
| Legacy dependency | High | High | Create modernization roadmap |

---

### 12. Alignment and Governance

Specifies how the solution aligns with enterprise governance.

- Related reference architectures or patterns used.  
- Enterprise architecture domain alignment (e.g., Data, Integration, Security).  
- Architecture Review Board (ARB) status and approvals.  
- Compliance with standards and policies.  

---

### 13. Future State and Lifecycle Considerations

Captures **how the solution will evolve over time**.

- Anticipated growth or expansion areas.  
- Known limitations or planned enhancements.  
- Technology lifecycle position (using the **TIME model** — Tolerate, Invest, Migrate, Eliminate).  
- Sunset strategy for replaced systems.

---

### 14. Appendices

Include supporting materials such as:
- Detailed diagrams (C4 model, sequence, deployment).  
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).  
- Glossary of terms.  
- References to related documents (Business Case, Security Review, NFR Traceability Matrix).

---

## Recommended Practices

- **Keep it concise:** Focus on intent and rationale, not exhaustive detail.  
- **Use visuals:** Diagrams and tables communicate faster than text.  
- **Version control:** Maintain in Git or Confluence with version history.  
- **Link, don’t duplicate:** Reference related documentation rather than copy content.  
- **Review and update:** Revisit during major milestones or design changes.  

---

## Recommended Tools and Templates

- **Markdown + GitHub / Azure DevOps Wiki:** Lightweight, version-controlled documentation.  
- **Confluence:** Centralized collaboration with templates and diagrams.  
- **Draw.io / Lucidchart / PlantUML:** Architecture diagramming tools.  
- **ADR Tools:** For structured decision logging (e.g., `adr-tools`, `log4brains`).  

---

## Key Takeaways

- The Solution Intent Document captures **why and what**, not every detail of **how**.  
- It is the **anchor document** for architecture alignment, decision traceability, and stakeholder communication.  
- The SID ensures solutions remain **strategically aligned, technically sound, and operationally feasible** before detailed design begins.  
- Keep it **living** — the SID evolves as the solution and understanding mature.
