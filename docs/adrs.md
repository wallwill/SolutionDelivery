# Empowering Architectural Excellence through Informed Decisions

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. Overarching principle is that ADRs should be context aware and demonstrate due diligence and critical analysis has been applied.

For the Enterprise , ADRs will give visibility to decisions that are typically made in meetings without record. As time passes, these are quickly forgotten as to the why of the meeting and who made them.   If implemented in such a way as to be correlated to entities of significance such as an Project ID or Application ID then reports can be generated which show the historical progression of an Architecture through its lifecycle and the decisions that went with it.

For the Architects and Application Teams, it expedites decision making through federated accountability while keeping technical decisions of significance closer to the project and execution teams.
