- Think **Big**, Act **Small**, Move **Fast** 

## Evolving the Practice Around “Just Enough Architecture” ##

A few key principles for a nimble, **product-centric** architecture practice, especially in an emerging GenAI enabled Software Engineering world.

- Spec driven everything-as-code.
- Focus on outcomes, not artefacts.
- Ask: “What decision are we enabling?”, "What is the value or cost savings ?" instead of “What template are we filling?”
- Promote shared ownership.Product owners, engineers and architects co-own decisions.
- Build alignment and avoid “throwing diagrams over the wall.”
- Architect through iteration.Draft early, get a conceptual diagram out there and refine with feedback.
- Avoid premature precision — evolve designs as product understanding grows.
- Automate compliance.
- Embed architectural and security rules into CI/CD pipelines rather than review checklists.
- Communicate through conversations and visuals.
- Prefer collaboration whiteboards, diagrams, and storytelling to text-heavy documents
- Keep Architectural Decision Records close to the product/application.
